The procedure uses applicative order evaluation, meaning both arguments are executed. With an `if` statement, only one of the arguments would be executed depending on whether the predicate returned `true` or `false`.

The fact that both arguments are executed with `new-if` means that this code will run in an infinite loop, because the second argument is a recursive call to `sqrt-iter`.

This points at the fact that `if` and `cond` are special forms, which have different behavior in Lisp.
